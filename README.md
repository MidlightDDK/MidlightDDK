👋 Hi, I’m AZAR Majed and I'm writting this down to introduce myself as a developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... a lot of things actually. My main focus is Game Development but I'd like to know about as many things as my lifetime would allow to. I deeply believe that if a lot of people like something, I can like it as well if I'm open-minded enough.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity for Game development. I won't stick to this forever tho. But for the time being, I'm a Game Dev !
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unity Games or C# projects. Since I want to be a Unity specialist, I'd rather work only on projects regarding that but still, when I don't have requests for Games, I can still work in C#. I can actually work in any programming language but to me, C# is the best option because I already use it in Unity. That's a win!
- 📫 How to reach me ? Well, my LinkedIn profile might be your best bet. I never miss a LinkedIn notification since it's job related... but I can afford to miss out on Twitter.

There you have it !
