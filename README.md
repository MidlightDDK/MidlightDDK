👋 Hi, I’m AZAR Majed and I'm writting this down to introduce myself as a developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in Competitive Programming and Backend Development! I love CP because I enjoy the competition. I take pride in being ranked high in anything I do in life so it goes without saying that the same applies in coding. About Backend Development, well, it's the closest thing to CP that I know about that you can get paid for. No UI/UX designs that you need to break down. Just... raw DATA... as I LOVE IT!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Competitive Programming. I'm already ranking pretty high in contests, but not high enough. I'm aiming for the #1 spot.
- 💞️ I’m honestly not really looking for collaboration. I'm a lone wolf.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Well, my LinkedIn profile might be your best bet. I never miss a LinkedIn notification since it's job related... but I can afford to miss out on other platforms. Here it is : https://www.linkedin.com/in/azarmajed/

There you have it !
