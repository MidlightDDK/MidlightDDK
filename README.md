👋 Hi, I’m AZAR Majed and I'm writting this down to introduce myself as a developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... a lot of things actually. I'd like to know about as many things as my lifetime would allow to. I deeply believe that if a lot of people like something, I can like it as well if I'm open-minded enough.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity for Game development. I won't stick to this forever tho. But for the time being, I'm a Game Dev !
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate right now. I might want to joke around on small projects but for the big boys... nah. I'm a lone Wolf. 
- 📫 How to reach me ? Well, my LinkedIn profile might be your best bet. I never miss a LinkedIn notification since it's job related... but I can afford to miss out on Twitter.

There you have it !
